This repository contains the code from the Blog series *Master Programming and Bioinformatics in One Strategic Journey*. Basically, the idea is to explore new programming languages by implementing commonly used bioinformatics tasks. The repository is organised by languages, and for each language, the same set of applications will be developed. The objective is to be able to compare the features of different programming languages and their efficiency, ergonomics, and general developer experience.

## Data
The file `data/files.json` contains the URLs of the files needed in this series, and the script `data/stage_data.py` will download it and organize it by the modules the files are needed in.
